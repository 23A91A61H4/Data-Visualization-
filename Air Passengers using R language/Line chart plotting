📊 Visualization Description

A line chart is used to represent the data.

The horizontal axis (X-axis) shows the time period (years).

The vertical axis (Y-axis) shows the number of air passengers.

Each point on the line represents passenger count for a particular month.

---

📈 Observations

The graph shows a clear increasing trend in the number of air passengers over time.

There are regular seasonal peaks, indicating higher passenger traffic during certain months every year.

After the mid-1950s, the growth in air passengers becomes faster, showing rapid expansion in air travel.

---

✅ Conclusion

The visualization clearly indicates that air passenger traffic has steadily increased from 1949 to 1960. This reflects:

Growth of the aviation industry

Increasing popularity of air travel

Presence of seasonal patterns in passenger movement.
